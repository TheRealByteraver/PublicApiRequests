# Public API Request app
This application uses a public api to display 12 business cards. When a card is clicked, a modal appears with more details about the person.

# Exceeds requirements description
The exceeds requirements have been fulfilled as described:
1. The search function has been implemented
2. The user can navigate through the details of every card using the 'Prev' and 'Next' buttons when the modal is visible
3. CSS was added to animate the cards a little bit: when the mouse hovers over a card, it gets a shadow and the cards slide a bit up to the top left, which makes it more visible that they are 'active' so to speak. I found the design pretty elegant and complete to begin with, so it was not easy to improve upon.
